## Unit and integration tests example

The idea of this tiny project is to show the segregation of approaches between unit and integration tests.

[Fastapi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is being used as web framework for the demo App.

[Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/) framework is being used for integration tests.

[Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) framework is being used for unit tests.
